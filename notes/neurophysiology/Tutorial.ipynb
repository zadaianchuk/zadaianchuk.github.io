    "> - VSD are lipofilic \n",
    "> - Because VSD are stain **all** surfaces of all cells they are applied to. So we don't have special geneticly encoded VSD to stain only one cell, for example. With calium dyes we can incert them only in one cell, or genetically encode, so only special cells (or cell types) have stained.\n",

In addition to Ileak our imaginary neuron possesses the two fast voltage and time – dependent sodium (INa) and delayed rectifier ($I_K$) conductances that usually generate the spike. In part C the task is to draw the (approximate) $I-V$ trajectory of a spike. Before doing that \n",

The sodium channel is activated at -50 mV and is rapidly deinactivated. The potassium channel is activated at -40 mV and is deactivated much slower compared to the sodium channel. Aided by the two curves you added in part A and B (IK,leak + Ileak and IK,leak + Ileak + INa,leak), draw the approximate I-V trajectory of a spike generated by intracellular injection of depolarizing current starting from rest and ending when the potential reaches rest again after the spike. The spike reaches a maximum of 20 mV.\n",
